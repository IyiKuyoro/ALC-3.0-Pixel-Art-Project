# Pixel Art Maker Project

This project was created as part of an UDACITY course. I take no credit for all of it, as I simply downloaded a starter code to complete it.

It is a simple page that simulates a pixel designer. I have written the JS code to aid easy resizing of the grid without having to lose any previous work done.

This branch was created for testing other classmate's code and helping them out. It will never be merged with the master branch.
